# IBPT Approximate Taxes
The Consumer Protection Code states that you must include in fiscal documents provided to consumers the approximate total amount of federal, state, and municipal taxes levied on the sale of goods or services.
Companies must include in a specific field in the fiscal document the approximate amount of taxes, per item or service sold. Additionally, the fiscal document header should include the total amount of taxes for all items and services sold.
The Brazilian Institute of Tax Planning (IBPT) provides a text file with the approximate average tax burden of all products and services, based on the Mercosur Common Nomenclature (NCM) and on the Brazilian Nomenclature Service (NBS).
